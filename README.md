# ABOUT SUBMISSION
## Intro
This project - HACK-MAN game was built using the technologies of Front End development which include HTML, CSS, JavaScript, bootstrap and Kaboom.js Framework. It is based upon the concept of Pac-Man, an arcade video game which was developed in the 80´s.

## Goal
The goal section provides a concise summary of the main objective or purpose of the project or software described in this README. It addresses the following aspects:

- ➡️ Problem Statement
The problem is that we needed to build a retro game, with neon colours and retro 80's music, using a JavaScript framework and front-end only development.

- ➡️ Objective(s)
In Hack-Man, the player makes the Hack-Man, a red and yellow disc, move around a maze. The ghosts are Blinky, Pinky, Inky, and Clyde. The goal is to eat every white pellet (circles) while not getting caught by the ghosts/monsters. For extra points, fruits that appear can also be eaten.

The player begins the game with 3 lives, and lose one each time Pac-man collides with a ghost. The game ends when all lives are lost.

- ➡️ Target Audience
The game is built for everyone.

- ➡️ Benefits
The benefits of the game are relaxation/recreation and entertainment.

## Controls
Describe briefly how the player controls the game.
The arrow keys (insert keys) are used to navigate through the maze. The arrow keys representing the various directions of up, down, left and right are used to move in any of these directions around the maze. When player collides with a point dot, it disappears and 10 points are added to the score.
When player collides with a fruit, it disappears and 100 points are added to the score. When player collides with enemy, the enemy disappears and 10 points are added to the score and the kaboom explosion animation plays in the enemy position. And on collision with a wall, enemy will bounce away by 1 pixel (to avoid wall clipping), then randomly turn left or right and continue moving
