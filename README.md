# ABOUT SUBMISSION
## Intro
Our retro game, Hack-Man, is based upon the concept of the 80s arcade video game Pac-Man, which was developed in the 80´s. We developed Hack-Man to be similar to this much-loved classic, with three main additions:
* Hack-Man has a unique appearance, based on the Code Institute logo.
* Retro gaming music plays in the background of the game.
* The game is styled throughout with neon colours to achieve a look reminiscent of 80s gaming.

## Goal

- ➡️ Problem Statement
* We are required to build a retro game, with neon colours and retro 80's music, using a JavaScript framework and front-end only development.
* Our solution was to build a copy of the 80's classic Pac-Man, with a few twists to make it our own.


- ➡️ Objective(s)
* The player must control the movement of Hack-Man around the maze, eating dots and fruit to gain points. The goal is to eat every dot whilst not getting caught by the enemy/ghosts.

* The player begins the game with 3 lives, and lose one each time Hack-Man collides with a ghost. The game ends when all lives are lost or the game is completed by eating all the dots in the maze.

- ➡️ Target Audience
* The game is built for people who enjoy retro gaming.
* The game can be enjoyed by anyone.

- ➡️ Benefits
* The benefits of the game are relaxation/recreation and entertainment.

## Game Play/ Features
* The arrow keys are used to navigate through the maze. When the Hack-Man collides with a point dot, it disappears and 10 points are added to the score. 
* When Hack-Man collides with a fruit, it disappears and 100 points are added to the score. 
* When Hack-Man collides with an enemy (ghost), 100 points are deducted from the score and one of three lives are lost. A Kaboom explosion animation appears in the enemy position.
* Hack-Man can tunnel from one side of the maze to the other.
* On collision with a wall, the enemy will bounce away from the wall and then turn randomly and continue moving.

## Technologies Used
* HTML
* CSS
* Bootstrap
* Kaboom JavaScript Framework
